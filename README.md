# Suicide-Rates-Study

Kia ora! Here you'll find relevant files for this suicide rates study. We will be modelling suicides per 100000 people in 4 OECD countries (New Zealand, South Korea, US and Netherlands) based on multiple socoioeconomic factors.

This is a public project, if you have any predictors that you think contribute significantly to predicting suicides, you're welcome to use our data as a base for your model.

To get started, you can familiarise yourself with our data using this shiny app: https://4q2fgc-luka0foy.shinyapps.io/interactivesuicideplots/?_ga=2.235376518.66622219.1666048774-1683258422.1666048774

Or, if you want to jump straight into it, you can download our R package containing all our wrangled datasets via:

library(devtools)

install_github('popsnot/suicidedata')

library(suicidedata)

Or, if you're more comfortable with CSVs - all the data is contained within the 'CSV Data' folder for free download
